# WiringBPi-M4Zero

This is someone else's work. I just deleted the parts I don't need.
It's GPIO for the Banana Pi M4 Zero.

Step 1
```chmod +x build reinstall```

Step 2
```sudo ./build```

You will see errors about things which were declared but never used. Ignore it.

Read all pins:
```sudo gpio readall```

Get Board Info
```gpio -v```

Blink an LED (shell script)
```#!/bin/sh -e

# LED Pin - wiringPi pin 1 is BCM_GPIO 18.
LED=1

gpio mode $LED out

while true; do
  gpio write $LED 1
  sleep 0.5
  gpio write $LED 0
  sleep 0.5
done```

========ORIGINAL README FROM DangKu/WiringPi=======================================================


WiringPi is a _performant_ GPIO access library written in C.


To compile programs with wiringPi, you need to include `wiringPi.h` as well as link against `wiringPi`:

```c
#include <wiringPi.h> // Include WiringPi library!

int main(void)
{
  // uses BCM numbering of the GPIOs and directly accesses the GPIO registers.
  wiringPiSetupGpio();

  // pin mode ..(INPUT, OUTPUT, PWM_OUTPUT)
  // set pin 17 to input
  pinMode(17, INPUT);

  // pull up/down mode (PUD_OFF, PUD_UP, PUD_DOWN) => down
  pullUpDnControl(17, PUD_DOWN);

  // get state of pin 17
  int value = digitalRead(17);

  if (HIGH == value)
  {
    // your code
  }
}
```

To compile this code, link against wiringPi:

```sh
gcc -o myapp myapp.c -l wiringPi
```

Be sure to check out the [examples](./examples/), build them using Make:

```sh
cd examples
make <example-name | really-all>
```

The tool `gpio` can be used to set single pins as well as get the state of everything at once:

## Support

Please use the [issue system](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi/issues) of GitHub.


## History

This repository is the continuation of 'Gordon's wiringPi' which has been [deprecated](https://web.archive.org/web/20220405225008/http://wiringpi.com/wiringpi-deprecated/), a while ago.

* The last "old wiringPi" source of Gordon's release can be found at the
  [`final_source_2.50`](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi/tree/final_official_2.50) tag.
* The default `master` branch contains code that has been written since version 2.5
  to provide support for newer hardware as well as new features.

:information_source:Ô∏è Since 2024, [GC2](https://github.com/GrazerComputerClub) has taken over maintenance of the project, supporting new OS versions as well as current hardware generations. We are dedicated to keeping the arguably best-performing GPIO Library for Raspberry Pi running smoothly. We strive to do our best, but please note that this is a community effort, and we cannot provide any guarantees or take responsibility for implementing specific features you may need.
